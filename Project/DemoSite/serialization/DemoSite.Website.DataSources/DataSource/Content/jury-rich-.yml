        <h3><strong>10 tips to rock your Hackathon Demo
        </strong></h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Be passionate! </li>
        <li>Know who is pitching (don&rsquo;t wait for the last moment) </li>
        <li>Think about the pitch early &ndash;write down ideas as they come up. </li>
        <li>Rest up &ndash;hackathons aren&rsquo;t marathons they&rsquo;re relay races! </li>
        <li>The golden points &ndash;start with the problem you are solving and the solution you have built, next the demo, finish off with next steps </li>
        <li>The importance of next steps &ndash;how to take it further! </li>
        <li>Don&rsquo;t memorize &ndash;use guideposts (don&rsquo;t memorize every stone in the road, memorize the turns) </li>
        <li>Do two things at once &ndash;instead of explaining what you see, talk about something you can&rsquo;t see (like your incredible back-end)! </li>
        <li>Anticipate questions &ndash;find another team to pitch to and vice versa </li>
        <li>Practise &ndash;hear the sound of your voice!</li>
        </ol>
